    <p><em>Development of the iPhone as a product began in 2005 and continued in complete secrecy until its public unveiling. The device broke with prevailing mobile phone designs by eliminating most physical hardware buttons, and eschewing a stylus for its screen-based interface, featuring instead only a few physical buttons and a touch screen.<br It featured quad-band GSM cellular connectivity with GPRS and EDGE support for data transfer, and it made use of continuous internet access and onboard processing to support features unrelated to voice communication. Its successor, >the iPhone 3G, was announced on June 9, 2008.</em></p>
